# Conjugate Gradient Optimization

This Python script solves a numerical optimization problem using the Conjugate Gradient algorithm. This algorithm is widely used to solve systems of linear equations, especially regarding large matrices.

## Use

1. Start optimization with the Conjugate Gradient algorithm by running the `main.py` file.

    ```bash
    python main.py

Examine the behavior of the algorithm by optionally changing the starting point, function, and other parameters.
